# TO DO

1. Arrange for uswgi to restart on boot (or document the steps)

1. Clean up the provisioning script to reflect a deploy to Raspbian.

1. Fix the abstraction leak on aisle 7: Don't require a `/vagrant` directory on the Pi.

1. The App structure is antique. Update it to something more modern.
